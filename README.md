## Circuit Design and Spice Simulation
Ckt design various component are connected in a certain format in order to perdfrom some functionality .  Generate the output wavefrom in spice simulation. A buffer have some input slew(delay) and some output load capacitance in according to that it have some value that is called delay of that buffer.

NMOS:- It is a four terminal(s,d,g,b) device consists of p substrate. Therr is a isolation region beside the source and drain diffusion region and in bw them a sio2 layer on top of that there is a matal layer. Vgs>0 so negative carrier move towards interface.Depletion region get from and increase.P->N Strong inversion(the voltage at which it is occur is threshold voltage) after that 
channel width increase and the electron is move towards source to drain.Generally vsb=0 if it is positive then at the source side depletion region gets increase due to rb. e is getting pulled in source side. so we apply more vgs to invert the channel.Qi is directly proportional to vgs-vt. Now by applying Vds>0 So from s(0) to d(vds) there is an voltage gradient. So voltage at channel vgs-vx.
