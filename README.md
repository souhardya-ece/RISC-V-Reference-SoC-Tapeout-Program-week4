## Circuit Design and Spice Simulation
Ckt design various component are connected in a certain format in order to perdfrom some functionality .  Generate the output wavefrom in spice simulation. A buffer have some input slew(delay) and some output load capacitance in according to that it have some value that is called delay of that buffer.
