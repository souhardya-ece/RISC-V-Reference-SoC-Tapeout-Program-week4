## Circuit Design and Spice Simulation
Ckt design various component are connected in a certain format in order to perdfrom some functionality .  Generate the output wavefrom in spice simulation. A buffer have some input slew(delay) and some output load capacitance in according to that it have some value that is called delay of that buffer.

NMOS:- It is a four terminal(s,d,g,b) device consists of p substrate. Therr is a isolation region beside the source and drain diffusion region and in bw them a sio2 layer on top of that there is a matal layer. Vgs>0 so negative carrier move towards interface.2
